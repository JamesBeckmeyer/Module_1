Crowdfunding Report

Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
The crowdfunding campaigns are least likely to be successful when launched in the month of August, where we see a spike in both failed campaigns and canceled campaigns. 
Crowdfunding campaigns are less likely to be launch in September, following the general performance in August.
Both conclusions can be tied to the largest parent and subcategories: Theater/Plays. This category and subcategory dominate the study. I suspect the patterns emerging may be influence by the seasonal nature of these categories.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
The discrepancy in volume within the subcategories may make it hard to determine if a trend is more is tied to the specific category versus crowdfunding in general. I also thing the range of dates may be too broad; the economic landscape over a 10-year period can be very volatile and may lead to outliers. 

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
I would like to see a table that looks at average donation per category. I think this would help describe what the market for specific campaigns looks like. I would also like to see the success rate plotted by average donation. I think this would help show if many small donations make a campaign successful, or if a few large donations do so.
